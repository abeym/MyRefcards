  ##### To debug a standalone java program
        Run it with:
        -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=1044
        Then go to eclipse debug configurations and create a remote java application configuration which uses 1044 as the port
        The application, at launch, will wait until you connect from another source.
